      "Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. - 1 Corinthians 13:4-7",
      "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. - John 3:16",
      "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. - Romans 5:8",
